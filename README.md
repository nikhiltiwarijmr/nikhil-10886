# Loop Optimization Demo

## Project Details
- **Project Title:** Loop Optimization Demo  
- **Language Used:** C  
- **Author:** Nikhil Kumar  
- **ERP No.:** RU-25-10886

## Aim
The aim of this project is to demonstrate loop optimization by converting seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds using both for loop and while loop, and comparing their iteration counts and results.

## Description
This project takes the total number of seconds as input from the user and converts it into hours, minutes, and remaining seconds.  
The conversion is performed using:
- **For Loop**
- **While Loop**

Iteration count is calculated for both loops and the results are compared to ensure correctness.

## Why This Project Was Made
- To understand the working of **for loop** and **while loop**  
- To compare iteration counts between loops  
- To practice basic C programming concepts  

## Utility
- Converts seconds into Hours , Minuts & Second format  
- Demonstrates loop execution clearly  
- Helpful for beginners learning loop optimization  

## Expected Output Example








## What I Learned
- Loop comparison and optimization  
- Iteration counting technique  
- Time conversion logic  
- Input handling in C  

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the comparison between for loop and while loop.  
Both loops produce the same output, proving correctness and helping understand loop behavior.
